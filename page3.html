  <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
  <p>My dream job to work at would be riot games as either a game developer or a job as an cybersecurity here I protect their company from attacks. Other than my dream I would like to pursue a career in cybersecurity. As I want to protect others from getting attacked and getting their data stolen, I find it interesting how someone like me can prevent unauthorised people such as hackers from accessing any data. In the end, if nothing works out for me and I do not find a job in the field I will likely join the air force and work in their IT department.</p>



<h2>About this Job</h2>

<p>
The words specialist makes it appealing to me as it provides me with a high status in life and the pay is appealing to me as the starting package is around 100k plus.
The skills and experience I would require getting into this career are a degree in either Bachelor of Computer Science, information technology, or a related discipline. I would also need to have some knowledge of the CyberArk security platform as I believe that is what I will be working on. I would also need at least 3 years of experience in the field of Building and Implementing CyberArk for Government Agencies while also working in a fast-paced environment. Not only that to be able to work independently and work in a team.
</p>

<p>I currently do not have much of the skills listed but some of the skills I do have is being able to work independently at university and high school during covid I had to learn on my own. I also have the skills in working in a fast-paced environment as I work at a cake shop and sometimes during the day a lot of customers come in which require me to work fast-paced.</p>

<p>The way I will be trying to get the other skills that are listed by the company is by applying to internship programs which will teach me the skills required to able to learn. I have heard of countries such as IBM that provide internships to students who are seeking a career in cybersecurity and telecommunications and provide the certain skills to be able to apply for a job they want in the future.</p>
