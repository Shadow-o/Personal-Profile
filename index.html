  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I was born in India and came to Australia when I was 2 years old, I speak both Hindi and Punjabi at home with my parents. I went to Albion North Primary School from Prep to Grade 4 until I had to move houses and change primary schools to Deer Park West primary school which I studied at from Grade 5 to Grade 6. The high school that I went to was Caroline Chisholm Catholic College which I graduated in 2020. I enjoy reading manga, watching anime, and chilling in my spare time.</p>

<h2>Personal Profle</h2>
<p>I did 3 tests which is tested by most employers to test their personalities and what type of person they would be in the workforce or how they would work if they were hired. The 3 test I did was the Myer-Briggs test, learning style and the Enneagram test.</p>
<h3>Myer-Briggs Test</h3>
<p>  I am a logistician in the 16-personality (Myer-Briggs) test which indicates that I am very sharp and have a fact-based mind. It also says in the Strengths and weakness section that my strengths are that I am honest, strong-willed, very responsible and calm, and practical. The weakness that the survey indicated out for me is that I am stubborn, insensitive, always by the book, judgmental and that I often blame myself. It also states that the way I approach things in life could sometimes be more of a liability than an asset.</p>
<h3>Learning Style Test</h3>
<p> I am a tactile type of learner which is basically where I learn better if I can touch and move about while I am trying to memorise and learn it will allow me to memorise things better. It also says that I should be doing something physical such as holding a stress ball, moving around, or listening to music while I study as it allows me to concentrate better. </p>
<h3>Enneagram Test</h3>
<p>I chose the enneagram test to show me my personality and from the results, it shows me about myself and what type of person I am, and, in the test, it shows that I am an individualist and a sceptic which is someone who seeks safety and security in their life. I also got the investigator trait which shows me that I am someone who likes to seek out knowledge and understanding and is less comfortable around people.</p>
